Auri - A way to set up volatile Arch Linux machines


What is Auri?

Auri is a software package specifically developed for Arch Linux. It allows for
booting complete setups from temporary filesystems, thus making them volatile.


Why is Auri useful?

Blocking all write operations to disk by using temporary filesystems on top of
read-only mounted devices can be of advantage in several scenarios:

- Single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi usually utilize SD cards for
  storage purposes which are prone to data corruption and wearout. Preventing
  the operating system from writing to disk effectively eliminates this problem.
  
- Embedded systems which are intended to serve a single purpose within a larger
  unit are often required to withstand power outages unharmed. Read-only
  filesystems provide a fresh installation at the beginning of each power cycle.
  
- Generic setups can benefit from the possibility of making temporary changes to
  the system and discarding them in case something goes wrong.


How does Auri work?

Auri relies on the Linux kernel feature OverlayFS, which is an implementation of
the Union Filesystem concept. In order to function properly, an initial RAM
filesystem needs to be used in conjunction with the kernel.

In early userspace, Auri mounts devices as configured either in read-only or
read-write mode before placing temporary filesystems on top of the read-only
filesystems. This way, all written files are caught and stored in RAM until the
system shuts down.


How can Auri be installed?

Auri is available on the Arch Linux User Repository and can be installed either
manually or using the AUR helper of choice.
