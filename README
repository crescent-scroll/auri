Auri - A way to set up static Arch Linux machines


What is Auri?

Auri is a software package specifically developed for Arch Linux. It allows to
boot complete setups from read-only filesystems, thus making them static.


When is Auri useful?

Blocking all write operations to the underlying devices by using read-only
filesystems can be of advantage in several scenarios:

- Single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi which utilize SD cards for
  storage purposes are prone to data corruption and wearout. Preventing the
  operating system from writing to disk effectively eliminates this problem.
  
- Embedded systems which are intended to serve a single purpose within a larger
  device are often required to withstand power outages unharmed. Read-only
  filesystems provide a fresh installation at the beginning of each power cycle.
  
- Generic setups can benefit from the possibility of making temporary changes to
  the system and discarding them in case something goes wrong.


How does Auri work?

Auri relies on the Linux kernel feature OverlayFS, which is an implementation of
the Union Filesystem concept. In order to function properly, it provides an
initial RAM filesystem that needs to be used in conjunction with the kernel.

In early userspace, Auri mounts a temporary filesystem on top of the read-only
mounted root device. This way all write operations are caught and stored in RAM
until the system shuts down.


How can Auri be installed?

Auri is available on the Arch Linux User Repository and can be installed either
manually or using the AUR helper of choice.


How can Auri be activated?

In order to use Auri, an initial RAM filesystem with the hook 'auri' needs to be
generated and enabled in the kernel command line. Visit the Arch Linux Wiki for
further reference.
